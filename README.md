Repository for my website at longbaonguyen.github.io

The website hosts resources, lecture notes, mini-courses in Computer Science and Math.

Currently, the entire curriculum for AP Computer Science Principles is available. A mini-course on Image Recognition with Neural Networks is also available. This mini-course is a 6 Youtube Lecture series on writing a Python program that recognizes handwritten digits from scratch, without using any deep learning libraries. 

Future mini-courses:
- Introduction Neural Networks with TensorFlow
- Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
- Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks
- Programming: A Visual Approach
- Explorations with Python
