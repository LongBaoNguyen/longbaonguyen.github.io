Repository for my website at [longbaonguyen.github.io.](https://longbaonguyen.github.io/)

The website hosts resources, lecture notes, mini-courses in Computer Science and Math.

Currently, the entire curriculum for [AP Computer Science Principles](https://longbaonguyen.github.io/courses/apcsp/apprinciples.html) is available. A mini-course on [Image Recognition with Neural Networks](https://longbaonguyen.github.io/courses/neural_network/intro_neural_network.html) is also available. This mini-course is a Youtube-Lecture series on writing a Python program that recognizes handwritten digits from scratch, without using any deep learning libraries. 

Future mini-courses:
- Introduction Neural Networks with TensorFlow
- Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
- Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks
- Programming: A Visual Approach
- Explorations with Python
