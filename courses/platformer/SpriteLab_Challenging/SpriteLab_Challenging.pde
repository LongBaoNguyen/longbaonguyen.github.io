/* Creating the Sprite Class Lab
   
   There are two versions of this lab:
   1) Friendly Version. More helper code is provided in lab template.
   2) More Challenging Version. Less helper code is provided.
   This is the challenging version.
   For more detail, see the tutorial: https://youtu.be/0Lk7WSDAIbk
   
   
   Complete the code as indicated by the comments.
   Do the following:
   1) Complete the Sprite class. 
   2) Create two objects of the Sprite(s1 and s2) class using 
      the "player.png" and "crate.png". Use a small scale(e.g. 0.5) for one
      Sprite and a large scale(e.g. 2.0) for another.
   3) Display each of them in draw(). 
   4) Give the player sprite a velocity and call update to see it moves.

//declare global variables
Sprite s1, s2;


//initialize them in setup().
void setup(){
  size(800, 600); // reserved variables width = 800, height = 600
  imageMode(CENTER);
  // create player sprite with small scale(e.g. 0.5).

  
  // create crate sprite with larger scale(e.g 2.0). 
  // Use reserved variables width, height to position this sprite.

}

// modify and update them in draw().
void draw(){
  background(255);
  
  // display and update s1 and s2.
  
}
